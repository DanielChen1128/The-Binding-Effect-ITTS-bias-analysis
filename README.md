## 📌 Overview

Bias evaluations in Instruction TTS (ITTS) usually test one attribute at a time, although real prompts combine social cues. This project studies how three theoretically grounded axes interact to shape the perceived gender of synthesized speech:

* **Social Status**: Weberian stratification represented with high/low Social Dominance Orientation descriptors.
* **Career**: Socially structured occupational roles with female-, mixed-, or male-leaning priors.
* **Persona**: Big Five traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.

> [!NOTE]
> **The Binding Effect:**  
> The **Binding Effect** is the non-additive interaction of these cues. The paper-primary probability is `female / (female + male + child)`, matching the event `D(y) = Female` over successful classifier outcomes. Unknown/failed outcomes have no `D(y)` result and are excluded but reported. Adult-only `female / (female + male)` is also reported separately.

---

## 💡 Method

The paper uses two stages:
1. **Stage 1** estimates the empirical female probability for each isolated descriptor.
2. **Stage 2** evaluates bi- and tri-dimensional combinations against those baselines.

For female probability `P(x)`, `L(x) = ln(P(x) / (1 - P(x)))`. Pairwise interaction is `I(w1,w2) = L(x_bi) - L(x_uni1) - L(x_uni2)`. Three-way interaction subtracts all univariate and pairwise effects from `L(x_multi)` as in paper equations 5 and 6. At an all-female or all-non-female boundary, the implementation applies the binomial Haldane-Anscombe correction `(female + 0.5) / (non-female + 0.5)`; interior proportions are unchanged.

The paper states 10,000 iterations with random-label shuffling but does not publish the exact algorithm. A pooled shuffle tests equality of condition probabilities, not the required additive-logit null `I = 0`. `analyze_interactions.py` therefore fits independent binomial condition probabilities constrained to `I = 0`, then performs 10,000 seeded random binary-label draws at the original condition sizes. It uses a two-sided statistic and the `(extreme + 1) / (iterations + 1)` Monte Carlo correction. This choice is explicitly a constrained-null randomization approximation to the unavailable paper implementation. Reports retain the paper's moderate (`p < 0.05`, `|I| > 1.0`) and strong (`p < 0.01`, `|I| > 2.8`) categories.

Optional `semantic_bias.py` implements equation 7, the female-minus-male anchor cosine bias `Delta`, and configured group comparisons with Cohen's d. It fails with an installation instruction when `sentence-transformers` is unavailable.

## 📊 Repository Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prompt Availability & Reproduction Gap:**  
> The prompt builder, generation, classifier, interaction-statistics, semantic-analysis, configuration preflight, and prompt-audit paths are runnable. Model weights, external TTS implementations, generated audio, paper outputs, and the full human-verified prompt collection are not bundled.
> 
> The paper specifies 13,300 prompts: 6,900 univariate and 6,400 compositional. The legacy `descriptions/` directory contains 5,900: 3,900 univariate and 2,000 compositional. The paper does not publish its literal templates, full descriptor list, human-verification records, ordering, or seeds, so exact reproduction remains unavailable.
>
> `build_prompts.py` provides a clearly labeled, deterministic **paper-aligned reconstruction**. It recovers ten transcripts and candidate descriptors from the legacy files, makes the 40-persona subset and ten-template expansion explicit, and builds Stage 2 only after ranking the user's own Stage 1 classifier results. Structural alignment is reproducible; identity with the original paper stimuli is not claimed.
> 
> The old `*_experiment.json` files referenced by the original experiment scripts are absent. Those scripts now state this and delegate to the actual files in `descriptions/` rather than silently skipping nonexistent inputs.

## 🛠️ Setup

See [`setup.txt`](setup.txt). A minimal analysis setup is:

```bash
conda create -n BindingBias python=3.9 -y
conda activate BindingBias
pip install torch==2.3.0 torchaudio==2.3.0 --index-url [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118)
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

> [!TIP]
> Heavy TTS imports are lazy, so `--help`, prompt audit, statistics tests, and generation `--check` do not load model code.

---

## 📦 External Assets

* **Parler-TTS:** Defaults to the public IDs `parler-tts/parler-tts-mini-v1` and `parler-tts/parler-tts-large-v1`. Install [Parler-TTS](https://github.com/huggingface/parler-tts); downloads follow Hugging Face cache settings.
* **PromptTTS++ & VoxInstruct:** Require separately obtained official source checkouts and checkpoint assets. They are supported through `--backend-path` plus `--model-id`, environment variables shown by preflight errors, or [`model_config.example.json`](model_config.example.json). No weights are redistributed here.
* **Classifier:** The acoustic classifier is AudEERING's [wav2vec2 age/gender model](https://zenodo.org/record/7761387) and downloads on first real analysis run.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Build Stage 1 Prompts

Build the paper's `69 × 10 × 10 = 6,900` univariate design:

```bash
python build_prompts.py stage1 \
  --source-dir descriptions \
  --output-dir reconstructed_prompts/stage1
python prompt_audit.py \
  --descriptions reconstructed_prompts/stage1 \
  --output reconstructed_prompts/stage1_manifest.json
```

The Stage 1 directory intentionally lacks compositional files, so its full-protocol count audit remains incomplete.

### 2. Validate Model Preflight

Validate without loading or downloading a model:

```bash
python generate_wav.py --model parler-mini --check
python generate_wav.py --model promptttspp --config model_config.json --check

```

### 3. Generate and Classify Stage 1

```bash
python generate_wav.py --model parler-mini \
  --model-revision COMMIT_SHA \
  --json reconstructed_prompts/stage1/descriptions_persona_bias.json \
  --output ITTS_audios/parler-mini/stage1-persona
python analyze_gender.py --wav_path ITTS_audios/parler-mini/stage1-persona \
  --json reconstructed_prompts/stage1/descriptions_persona_bias.json \
  --model-name parler-mini \
  --output analysis/parler-mini/stage1-persona

```

Repeat generation and classification for status and career. Outputs preserve all protocol metadata, include `detection_results.csv`, and report trait/keyword summaries. Generation applies each row's deterministic seed and writes `generation_manifest.json`; pin Parler to a commit revision and use immutable local checkpoint directories. Backend and hardware differences can still prevent bitwise-identical audio. Existing valid WAVs are skipped unless `--no-skip` is passed.

### 4. Build Model-Specific Stage 2

Stage 2 selects the two lowest and two highest career and persona female probabilities from that model's Stage 1 results, then builds all 32 bi-axis and 32 tri-axis cells:

```bash
python build_prompts.py stage2 \
  --stage1-dir reconstructed_prompts/stage1 \
  --detections \
    analysis/parler-mini/stage1-status/detection_results.csv \
    analysis/parler-mini/stage1-career/detection_results.csv \
    analysis/parler-mini/stage1-persona/detection_results.csv \
  --model-name parler-mini \
  --output-dir reconstructed_prompts/parler-mini
python prompt_audit.py \
  --descriptions reconstructed_prompts/parler-mini \
  --output reconstructed_prompts/parler-mini_manifest.json \
  --strict-reconstruction
```

The complete output contains 13,300 structurally aligned prompts plus `_protocol/stage2_selection.json`. `--strict-paper` still fails by design because no published hashes can establish original content identity.

### 5. Analyze Interactions

For interactions, provide a JSON spec whose order-2 entries contain exactly three conditions in `[joint, uni1, uni2]` order, or whose order-3 entries contain seven in `[triple, pair12, pair13, pair23, uni1, uni2, uni3]` order. Every condition has `name` and a `csv` path to classifier output:

```bash
python analyze_interactions.py --spec interactions.json --output analysis/interactions.csv
python semantic_bias.py --spec semantic.json --output analysis/semantic.json

```

### 6. Batch Execution

Batch generation and analysis use all four configured models:

```bash
CONFIG_PATH=./model_config.json OUTPUT_BASE=./ITTS_audios bash run_all_models.sh
WAV_BASE=./ITTS_audios ANALYSIS_BASE=./analysis bash analyze_all_models.sh

```

Generation exits nonzero if any item fails. Batch scripts continue to report all incomplete model/dataset combinations, then exit nonzero if any generation, missing WAV set, or analysis failed.

## 🔬 Reproducibility and Paper Alignment

Run the prompt audit and offline tests with no model or network:

```bash
python prompt_audit.py --output prompt_manifest.json
python prompt_audit.py --strict-paper  # always fails: original content identity is unverifiable
python -m unittest discover -v

```

The audit distinguishes schema validity, paper count/Cartesian alignment, and original-content identity. The implementation aligns with paper equations 5-7, uses 10,000 constrained-null randomizations as documented above, validates complete named interaction condition sets, includes `child` as a non-female paper-primary classifier outcome, and reports adult-only and unknown outcomes separately. Reproducing paper tables additionally requires the missing human-verified prompts, original model/checkpoint versions, generated waveforms, classifier audit data, and the authors' exact permutation implementation; these remain unresolved external blockers.
